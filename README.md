# CupcakeShoppe
I completed this project for my Web Development and Programming course in NYU's Computer Science department. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I designed an online cupcake store that allows the user to order the number and type of cupcake they desire, enter delivery and payment information, and create an account with the store.
